## Details
This project demonstrates a clean and exam-oriented implementation of object-oriented programming in C++ with a focus on exception handling and object lifecycle management. Using a simple BankAccount model, it shows how constructors and member functions can safely validate data, throw exceptions, and ensure proper cleanup through destructors when objects are dynamically allocated. The project is well-suited for learning and demonstrating core C++ concepts such as classes, constructors/destructors, try-throw-catch flow, and safe memory management in a controlled, real-world–inspired scenario.
